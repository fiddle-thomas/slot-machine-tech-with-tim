# slot-machine-tech-with-tim

This repository contains my implementation of the slot machine project from the YouTube tutorial "Learn Python With This ONE Project!" by the channel 'Tech With Tim'. The project is a great exercise for learning Python.

## Project Description

In this video, Tech With Tim teaches Python by working through a project from scratch. The goal is not only to teach basic Python syntax and various language features but also to explain how to structure a program, decide where to start, and identify different components to build out. This project is ideal for project-based learning, making it perfect for those with some experience in Python who are not yet comfortable writing their own projects independently. By following along, you'll gain confidence, learn a lot about Python, and have a good project to show at the end.

The project is a text-based slot machine game where the user deposits money, bets on one, two, or three lines, and plays until they either cash out or run out of money. The game involves collecting deposits, allowing bets, determining winnings, spinning the slot machine, and generating the slot machine items.
